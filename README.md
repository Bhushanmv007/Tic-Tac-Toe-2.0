# Tic Tac Toe 2.0 ðŸŽ® 
## Overview
This is a modern take on the classic Tic Tac Toe game, built using Python and Tkinter. The game introduces an intriguing twist: starting from the 4th move, each player's earliest moves are discarded in sequential order, adding an extra layer of strategy and unpredictability. This feature ensures that as the game progresses, players must adapt their strategies to account for the loss of their previous moves. This project is perfect for those looking to explore Python GUI development and game logic implementation.

## Key Features
* **Classic Tic Tac Toe Gameplay:** Simple and intuitive 3x3 grid where two players, X and O, take turns..
* **Twist:** On every 4th turn of each player, the player's first move is automatically removed, requiring them to rethink their strategy.
* **Interactive UI:** Built using Tkinter, offering a clean and responsive user interface.
* **Easy Reset:** The game automatically resets after a win or draw, allowing for continuous play.
* **Fully Commented Code:** The code is well-documented, making it easy to understand and modify.

## How to Play:
* The game starts with Player X.
* Players take turns by clicking on the buttons in the grid to place their symbol (X or O).
* On every 4th turn, the playerâ€™s first move is removed, creating new opportunities and challenges.
* The game ends when one player achieves three symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or if the grid is filled without a winner (a draw).

## Requirements:
* Python 3.x
* Tkinter
